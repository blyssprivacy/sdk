# Getting started

The Blyss bucket service is a key-value store (similar to Amazon S3 or Redis) that allows private retrievals using homomorphic encryption.

The special privacy property of Blyss is that retrieval from a bucket is _completely_ private. No entity, _not even the Blyss service itself_, can determine what key a client retrieves. This property is cryptographic; it's not based on the security of special hardware enclaves or trusted third parties. You can read more about the security properties in ["How it works"](./how-it-works).

You can use the Blyss bucket service to build fundamentally new kinds of privacy-preserving applications that collect less information from users.

:::caution

The Blyss bucket service is in beta. Data stored in Blyss should not be considered durable. [Contact us](mailto:founders@blyss.dev) if you need access to a higher level of service.

### Get your API key

To get an API key, [sign up here](https://blyss.dev). You will see an API key in the [Blyss Console](https://console.blyss.dev) once you log in.

An API key allows you to create buckets and read and write to them. Your API key does not encrypt anything - it is only used for rate-limiting and enforcing bucket ownership.

### Use the SDK to make private retrievals

To make queries against a Blyss bucket, you will need the **Blyss SDK** for your preferred programming language. Currently, only JavaScript/TypeScript is supported.

You can try the SDK directly from your browser using [our CodeSandbox](#). 

To use the SDK in an existing project, check out [our repository](#).
